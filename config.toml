The game’s framework is built as an event driven architecture using [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) for passing messages.\n\nAt the core is the game’s 'WarServer' which provides most of the game's services such as login, matchmaking, statistics, metrics, transactions, handling results of games, etc. These services are consumed by various parts of the game - web client, FPS game, and mobile client.\n\n- Implement handlers that service game clients. For example, buying soldiers, equipping/un-equipping items on soldiers, execute movement orders for units, etc.\n\n- The architecture is based on an in-memory key-value data storage. However, one issue with such a system was handling multiple updated to the same object before transaction was finalized. I implemented a data layer that would allow this functionality by caching intermediate results.\n\n- Some of the game's immutable data had to be accessed through the in-memory data storage system, which was hurting performance. I implemented a cache data layer that improved access to this data by about 10 times.\n\n- Data Management: Handling tasks related to management, upgrade, upkeep, and trouble-shooting on the game's dataset which is stored on SQL database servers."
